# Advanced-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning projects using classification, neural networs and CNNs

### Final project of the subject AAA (Aprendizagem Automática Avançada)

Mestrado Engenharia Informática e Multimédia - ISEL

---

#### The first project is based on the binary and multi-class classification of images using the CIFAR-10 database.

* In both tasks it was verified if the usage of normalization was beneficial.
* In the multi-class classification task, the data was transformed with PCA.
* The results were analyzed with different methods like confusion matrixes and score metrics.

----

#### The second project is based on implementing, training and testing Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks.

* A three-layer MLP network, for the task of binary classification of two-dimensional data (XOR pro-blem) was implemented without
resorting to any library like TensorFlow/Keras.

* In the second objective several MLP networks were trained with the databaseCIFAR-10.

#### The third project is the binary and multi-class classification of images through convolutional neural networks (CNNs), using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset database.

The binary classification task consists of distinguishing between images of dogs and cats, and
the multi-class classification task consists of classifying images into one of 37 breeds of dogs
and cats. 

* For both tasks a CNN network was trained from scratch.
* A pre-trained Keras Network was chosen, and applied to the multi-class classification task.
* Data augmentation techniques were used.
