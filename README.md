The first project is based on the binary and multi-class classification of images using the CIFAR-10 database.

* In both tasks it was verified if the usage of normalization was beneficial.
* In the multi-class classification task, the data was transformed with PCA.
* The results were analyzed with different methods like confusion matrixes and score metrics.
